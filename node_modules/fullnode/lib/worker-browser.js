/**
 * Worker
 * ======
 *
 * This class is for running CPU-heavy, blocking operations. It either runs in
 * a separate process (in node), or in a web worker thread (in a browser). It
 * receives messages from outside, performs the computation, and then sends
 * back the result. You probably don't want to use this file directly, but
 * rather Work, which will automatically spawn workers if necessary and send
 * commands to them. Note that the source code for worker-node and
 * worker-browser are almost equivalent, except for code that manages the
 * differences at the bottom. This is done deliberately, so that the browser
 * version can be minimized properly.
