/**
 * Injector
 * ========
 *
 * In order to allow injecting dependencies, Fullnode classes provide an
 * "inject" method that makes a new class with injected dependencies. However,
 * that method by itself presents a problem, because it creates a new class
 * every time it is used, leaving the burden of caching the classes to the
 * user. Thus the injector allows us to easily wrap an inject method that keeps
 * a cache of the created classes, lowing memory burden, and allowing the
 * instanceof operator to work correctly.
